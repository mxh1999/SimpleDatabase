Write-up for lab-1

Design:

I try to use the most efficient and simple way to implement lab1. So I try to contain few members in iterators and avoid using containers as possible as I can. I think it's efficient but it may cause some trouble in lab5.

API:

I think "HeapFile.java/readPage" should throw some exception which API doesn't declare. I choose not to change the API and just do nothing when exception occurs.

Incomplete elements:

I try my best to deal with null but maybe there are still some bugs. I'm not good at considering this.

Difficulties:

It took me several nights to complete lab1. I think it's difficult to know the relation among these classes.
