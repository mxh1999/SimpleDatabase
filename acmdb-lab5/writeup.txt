Write-up for lab-5

Design:

I design a lockmanager to manage locks.
A lockmanager contains two hashmaps:
One records the set of TransactionId which operators (read/write) the specific page. 
Another records the set of PageId which this transaction operates.

Based on this, every page has some state: 
EMPTY means no transaction is operating it.
READ1 means exactly one transaction is reading it.
WRITE means exactly one transaction is reading and writing it.
READ2 means more than one transactions are reading it.

Please refer to getlock() in LockManager.java for details.

If a getPage() fails to require a lock, it will wait for 100ms and try again. If it has failed for more than 10 times, I assume there's a deadlock and throw a TransactionAbortedException.


API:

I don't change any API of lab5.

Incomplete elements:

None

Difficulties:

I tried to implement a dependency graph but failed.
