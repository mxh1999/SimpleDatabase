Write-up for lab-3

Design:

As time is limited, I don't implement any outstanding design in lab3 which may lead to my program running slowly.


API:

I don't change any API of lab3.
What's more, in Insert.java/fetchNext() and Delete.java/fetchNext() I just ignore IOException because of API.

Incomplete elements:

None

Difficulties:

It took me some days to complete lab3. I think it's very hard to debug when I made some mistakes in lab1/lab2.

Contest:

My program runs 5.2s in contest1.
It runs over a lot of minutes in contest2. I killed it before terminated.
